# DO NOT USE THIS CONFIG WITHOUT KNOWING WHAT EVERYTHING IN IT DOES/HOW IT WORKS!!!!

# You should read the comments (lines starting with a # like this one) in full since they
# explain in great detail what each setting in this config does. If you still don't
# understand something, GOOGLE IT!

# Hopefully it's obvious that example.com is just a placeholder and that you need to replace
# "example.com" with your actual domain where it appears below for any of this to work.
# IPs in the 192.0.2.0/24 range are also examples, and should be replaced with your own IPs.










# First, we want to permanently rewrite our site's www subdomain to the base domain for SEO reasons.
# You can do this the other way around if you want (rewrite base domain to www), but only do one and
# stick with it, otherwise visitors could end up in a redirect loop until they clear their cache.
server {
	server_name www.example.com;
	# Using $scheme allows this to work with both https and http requests.
	rewrite ^ $scheme://example.com$request_uri permanent;
}

server {
	# Port that nginx should listen on, this should be 80 in most if not all cases.
	listen 80;

	# Root folder for all of this site's files. We use /home/ for this since in most
	# environments it has a larger quota. Change www-user to the name of your web user.
	root /home/www-user/example.com/;

	# Files to treat as indexs. Remove index.php as an option if you don't have PHP enabled.
	index index.html index.htm index.php;

	# Domain(s) for this site. You can define more than one if you wish by seperating them with a space.
	server_name example.com example.org example.net;

	# Location blocks are used to define rules for a URI
	# Locations are relitive, so / means the entire site starting from the root folder defined above.
	location / {
		# First we want to try to serve a requested URI as file, then a directory. If that fails, the
		# requested resource doesn't exist, and we should fall back to displaying a 404.
		try_files $uri $uri/ 404;
	}

	# Next we need to define custom error pages since the default nginx ones are pretty boring.
	# Only the first entry will be commented, but all comments for the 404 location block apply to
	# the 403 and 50x entries as well.

	# First we define that this error page is only for 404 errors. We then tell the server that the
	# file we should serve for this error is called 404.html and is located in the root of our website.
	error_page 404 /404.html;
	# We set the location of the error page to internal to prevent clients from fetching it directly.
	location  /404.html {
		internal;
	}

	# 403 Forbidden
	error_page 403 /403.html;
	location  /403.html {
		internal;
	}

	# 50x Server Errors
	# These all point to the same error page since users don't need the exact reason why the site broke,
	# and the as the system admin you can just check /var/logs/nginx/error.log to get the info you need.
	error_page 500 502 503 504 /50x.html;
	location  /50x.html {
		internal;
	}
	
	# You can add custom server error pages for other error types here as you see fit using the above
	# entries as a template. Note that it is good practice to at least have custom 404 and 403 pages.


	# Finaly, we setup PHP5 using fpm. If you don't require PHP, just delete / comment out the following
	# block and don't install PHP since it can be a constant headache and a security issue at times.

	# First, we tell nginx that this config block only should be used with requests to files ending with
	# the extension ".php". Feel free to modify the regex rule to allow for other extensions as needed.
	location ~ \.php$ {
		# If the file requested doesn't exist, display a 404 "Not Found" error.
		try_files $uri =404;

		# If the requested file does exist, we pass it to the PHP-FPM process listening on the unix
		# socket at "unix:/var/run/php5-fpm.sock" via FastCGI for parsing (socket location may vary).
		fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/php5-fpm.sock;

		# Alternatively, we can pass it to a different PHP-FPM process listening on a local port...
		#fastcgi_pass 127.0.0.1:9000;

		# Or we could even pass it to an entirely different remote server running PHP-FPM to offload
		# the process from the main machine(s). Make sure to firewall off the remote server from unknown
		# traffic (read: everything but your frontend webservers) using something like IPTables.
		#fastcgi_pass 192.0.2.1

		# Next, we define the "index" filename. Should be the same as the index file we defined earlier.
		fastcgi_index index.php;
		
		# Finally, we define a list of parameters that are required by the PHP-FPM process...
		fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME $document_root$fastcgi_script_name;
		# ...and then include them with the passed request.
		include fastcgi_params;
	}

# And that's it.
}
