###About
The point of this repo is to have a set of (hopefully) sane and safe defaults that I can use for my sites and point people to when they ask (too many) questions.


###Contributing
If you notice that I have done something wrong ([like using the evil if when there is a better way to do things](http://wiki.nginx.org/IfIsEvil)) feel free to open a pull request with an explaination of your change.
